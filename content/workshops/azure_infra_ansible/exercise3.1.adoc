= Exercise 3.1 - Creating Ansible Workflow

== Exercise Description
In this exercise we will be creating a Workflow to create a new Azure Virtual Machine, Install Apache, and STIG test the new environment.

Workflows can be made in straight lines like we are going to address here, or split out into multiple facets.

More information on workflows can be found link:{workflow_url}[here].

== Section 1: Creating the Workflow

=== Step 1: Create a new Workflow

Select TEMPLATES image:at_templates.png[temp,120,35]

=== Step 2: Create a new Job Workflow template

Click image:at_add.png[Add,35,25], and select JOB TEMPLATE image:workflow.png[jobT,150,100]

=== Step 3: Complete the Workflow Job Template form

Complete the template form, by entering the following values:

|===
|NAME |Azure-Workflow
|DESCRIPTION|Workflow to build infra, install apache, and STIG test
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|===

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save]

That will then bring up the *WORKFLOW VISUALIZER*.

=== Step 4: Creating the Workflow

Select the image:workflow_start.png[Start]

That will bring up the *ADD A TEMPLATE* page.

image:add_a_template.png[ADD]

Select the *Azure-Infra template* then press *SELECT*

image:azure_job.png[Select]

Once that is completed you will see *Azure-Infra* has been added to our workflow. Hover over *Azure-Infra* and select the *green plus symbol*

image:azure_add_job1.png[ADD_Job]

This will bring back up the *ADD A TEMPLATE* page.

Select *Apache Basic Job Template* then press *SELECT*

image:azure_apache_job.png[ADD_Job]

Once that is completed you will see *Apache Basic Job Template* has been added to our workflow. From here we will add one final template, so hover over the *Apache Basic Job Template* and select the *green plus symbol*

image:azure_apache_workflow.png[Workflow]

This will once agin bring back up the *ADD A TEMPLATE* page.

Select *STIG Job Template* then press *SELECT*

image:stig_template.png[STIG]

Our Final Workflow should look like the example below.

image:final_workflow.png[WORKFLOW]

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save]

=== Step 5: Adding Surveys

Back on the Template overview screen select *ADD SURVEY*

image:azure_survey.png[SURVEY,100,35]

We will now add three seperate Surveys.

The first Survey will be to add your Student Number as a Variable. Fill out the survey with the infromation below.

|===
|PROMPT|Student Number
|DESCRIPTION|What is your workshop student number?
|ANSWER VARIABLE NAME|student_number
|ANSWER TYPE| Integer
|MINIMUM| 1
|MAXIMUM| 50
|DEFAULT| {{< urifqdn_azure_login "" >}}
|===

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save]

image:survey1.png[survey1]

The second Survey will create a variable for your Virtual machine. Since we used 1 in our first creation this will default to 2 for the second machine.

|===
|PROMPT|Virtual Machine Number
|DESCRIPTION|Virtual Machine Number for DNS name
|ANSWER VARIABLE NAME|virtual_machine_num
|ANSWER TYPE| Integer
|MINIMUM| 1
|MAXIMUM| 5
|DEFAULT| 2
|===

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save]

image:surve2.png[survey2]

The final Survey will be for the apache server test message just like we created earlier.

|===
|PROMPT|Please enter a test message for your new website
|DESCRIPTION|Website test message prompt
|ANSWER VARIABLE NAME|apache_test_message
|ANSWER TYPE| Text
|MINIMUM LENGTH| 0
|MAXIMUM LENGTH| 1024
|DEFAULT ANSWER| Be creative, keep it clean, weâ€™re all professionals here
|===

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save]

image:survey3.png[survey3]

Then Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save] again on the Workflow Template.

=== Step 6: Preemptive Strike

So what is this workflow actaully doing? It will be taking the template we created in Exercise 3.0 and building out a new virtual machine using the exesting security group and virtual network.
It will then be taking the templates that we created in exercise 1.2 and 2.2 to install apache and run the STIG test against the new machine.
The only thing that we are missing is the machine name in the inventory. Since we already know what the DNS name will be, we will preemptively add the machine to our inventory before the workflow is run.

Click on INVENTORIES image:at_inv_icon.png[Inv,100,35]

Select the *Ansible Workshop Inventory*

Select *HOSTS* then select the *Green Plus* symbol to add a host.

Add your *HOST NAME* {{< urifqdn_azure_vm "Student" "vm2" >}}

image:azure_hosts.png[hosts,100,35]

Then Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save]

Next Select *GROUPS* at the top and then select the *Green Plus* symbol to associate the host with an existing group.

Select *web* then Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save]

image:azure_group.png[group]

== Section 2: Running Our Workflow

=== Step 1: Launch the Template

Select TEMPLATES image:at_templates.png[temp,120,35]

Click on the rocketship icon image:at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *Azure-Workflow* Job Template

[NOTE]
Review the prompts and make sure it is using your correct *STUDENT NUMBER {{< urifqdn_azure_login "" >}}*, the *VIRTUAL MACHINE NUMBER* of *2*, and input your *test message*

Then select NEXT image:next.png[next]

Then select LAUNCH image:launch.png[launch]


=== Step 2: Review the Job Run

Once the template is launched it will automatically bring you into the jobs screen. Inside of this screen you can see each template in the workflow and its status.
You can even click on the individual templates to bring up job details as it is running or after it has completed.

Once your Workflow completes it should look like the picture below.

image:workflow_complete.png[completed workflow]

You should also be able to refresh you list of resources inside Azure and view what has been created.

image:azure_resources_complete.png[az_resources]

[NOTE]
Notice that we created a new Network interface (NI2), a new Public IP address (PubIP2), and a new Virtual Machine (vm2).
We didn't create a new Virtual Network, Security Group, or Subnet. Since we already had those in palce we just utilized them with the new Virtual Machine.

=== Step 3: Review

Now lets take a look at the new system that we created.

[source,bash]
----
http://{{< urifqdn_azure_vm "Student" "vm2" >}}
----

If all went well, you should see something like this, but with your own custom message:

= Exercise 3.0 - Tying it All Together

== Exercise Description
In this exercise, we are going to configure Tower so that we can run a new playbook for Azure Infrastructure.
[NOTE]

There are a number of constructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc.
However, we are only going to focus on a few of the key concepts required for this workshop today.

* Credentials
* Projects
* Inventory
* Job Template

== Section 1: Creating Credentials
Creating a Credential

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching jobs against machines,
synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

There are many link:{cred_url}[types of credentials] including machine, network, and various cloud providers.  In this workshop, we are using a *Microsoft Azure Resource Manager* credential.


=== Step 1: Select Credentials

Select CREDENTIALS image:at_credentials.png[Cred,100,35]

=== Step 2: Select Add
Select ADD image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3: Complete the Ansible Tower Credentials form

Complete the form, using the following entries.

|===
|NAME |Azure Credentials

== Section 2: Creating a Project

A Project is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks, represented in Tower.
You can manage playbooks and playbook directories, by either placing them manually
under the Project Base Path on your Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into
a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

=== Step 1: Open a new project

Click on PROJECTS image:at_projects_icon.png[Proj,100,35]

=== Step 2: Add the project

Select  ADD   image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3: Complete the Project form

Complete the form using the following entries:

|===
|NAME |Azure Project
|DESCRIPTION|Azure Infrastructure Setup
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|SCM TYPE|Git
|SCM URL| https://github.com/Joel-Adams/lightbulb.git

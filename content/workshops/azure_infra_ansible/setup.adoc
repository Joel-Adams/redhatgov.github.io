This lab provides a quick tour of the browser based SSH client Wetty. To help you get familiar with lab environment along with some key terminology we will use in subsequent lab content.

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!

[NOTE]
To copy and paste in Wetty you use Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v just like you would in a regular text file. 

== End Result

At this point, you should have logged into your node.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.

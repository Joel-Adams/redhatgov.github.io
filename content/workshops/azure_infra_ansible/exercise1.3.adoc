= Exercise 1.3 - Running Your Completed Playbook

== Exercise Description

In previous exercises, we showed you the how to create a playbook.  In this exercise we are going to show you how to run that playbook.


== Section 1: Creating SSH Keys


To begin, we are going to create SSH keys that will be used to connect to the Virtual Machine.

If you notice in exercise 1.2 the task of *Create Azure RHEL Virtual Machine* uses local SSH key data. This data is used in the creation
of the virtual machine and needs to be populated before the playbook is run.

=== Step 1: Creat SSH Key

We will be creating an SSH key using the default variables without a password.

[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
----

Once that command is run leave the passphrase blank and press enter. Then press enter again for the same passphrase.

=== Step 2: Run your playbook

From your playbook directory ( `~/azure_infra` ), run your playbook.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i ../hosts create_azure_infra.yml
----

[NOTE]
As you will notice the Task *Create Azure Network* responds with ok. This is due to the fact it was already previously created.
Ansible noted that the virtual network was already in place and there was nothing more to do.

Now if you log back into your Azure Portal and refresh all of the resources you will see everything that we just created using Ansible!

[NOTE]
But wait.... where did that storage account come from? When you create the virtual machine using a Market Place image from Azure
it automatically creates a Storage account for the Operating System if one is not defined. We could have also created a Storage account
and created multiple disk for the virtual machine. To see all of the options when creating a virtual machine see the parameters section link:{ansible_module}[here].

== Section 2: Bad Playbook

As you can see the playbook works as directed and creates multiple resources inside Azure. There is only one problem. The playbook that we created uses
defined static variables throughout. This is not repeatable nor easy to update. In later exercises you will learn more about using Variables and Roles
inside your playbook to achive a resuible structure.

For example, this is what the playbook would look like if we had defined variables inside the playbook.

[source,bash]
----

- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  name: Create Instances in Azure

  gather_facts: no

      virtual_network_name: "{{ virtual_network_name }}"
      address_prefix_cidr: "{{ subnet_cidr }}"

  - name: Create a public ip address
    azure_rm_publicipaddress:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
      name: "{{ public_ip_name }}"
      allocation_method: Dynamic
      domain_name: "{{ domain_name }}"

  - name: Create Azure security group for the virtual network named "{{ virtual_network_name }}"
    azure_rm_securitygroup:
      name: "{{ security_group_name }}"
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group_name }}"

          direction: Outbound

          public_ip_address_name: {{< urifqdn_azure_login "Student" "-PubIP" >}}

  - name: Create Azure RHEL Virtual Machine
    azure_rm_virtualmachine:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
      name: "{{ virtual_machine_name }}"
      vm_size: Standard_B2s
      admin_username: {{< urifqdn_azure_login "Student" >}}
      admin_password: RedHatSNX123!
      network_interface_names: "{{ network_interface_name }}"
      image:
        offer: RHEL
        publisher: RedHat
        sku: '7-RAW'
        version: latest
      ssh_public_keys:
        - path: /home/{{< urifqdn_azure_login "Student" >}}/.ssh/authorized_keys
          key_data: "{{lookup('file', '/home/azure-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub')}}"
----

By just updating the variables we would now be able to run this playbook again and create an entirely new Azure Infrastructure.

= Exercise 1.3 - Running Your Completed Playbook

== Exercise Description

In previous exercises, we showed you the how to create a playbook.  In this exercise we are going to show you how to run that playbook.


== Section 1: Creating SSH Keys


To begin, we are going to create SSH keys that will be used to connect to the Virtual Machine.

If you notice in exercise 1.2 the task of *Create Azure RHEL Virtual Machine* uses local SSH key data. This data is used in the creation
of the virtual machine and needs to be populated before the playbook is run.

=== Step 1: Creat SSH Key

We will be creating an SSH key using the default variables without a password.

[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
----

Once that command is run leave the passphrase blank and press enter. Then press enter again for the same passphrase.

=== Step 2: Run your playbook

From your playbook directory ( `~/azure_infra` ), run your playbook.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i ../hosts create_azure_infra.yml
----

=== Step 3: Add a task

Add a new task called *install httpd packages*.

[source,bash]
----
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd packages
      package:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: "{{ httpd_packages }}"
      notify: restart apache service
----

[NOTE]
====
Explanation of the *install httpd packages* task actions. +

- `vars:` You've told Ansible the next thing it sees will be a variable name +
- `httpd_packages` You are defining a list-type variable called httpd_packages.  What follows
is a list of those packages +
- `{{ item }}` You are telling Ansible that this will expand into a list item like `httpd` and `mod_wsgi`. +
- `with_items: "{{ httpd_packages }}` This is your loop which is instructing Ansible to perform this task on
every `item` in `httpd_packages`
- `notify: restart apache service` This statement is a `handler`, so we'll come back to it in Section 3.
====


== Section 2: Deploying files and starting a service

When you need to do pretty much anything with files and directories, use one of the link:{file_url}[Ansible Files] modules.  In this case, we'll leverage the `file` and `template` modules.

After that, you will define a task to start the start the apache service.


=== Step 1: Create a template directory
Create a `templates` directory in your project directory and download two files.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir templates
cd templates
curl -O http://ansible-workshop.redhatgov.io/workshop-files/httpd.conf.j2
curl -O http://ansible-workshop.redhatgov.io/workshop-files/index.html.j2
----

=== Step 2: Add file and service tasks
Add some file tasks and a service task to your playbook.

[source,bash]
----
    - name: create site-enabled directory
      file:
        name: /etc/httpd/conf/sites-enabled
        state: directory

    - name: copy httpd.conf
      template:
        src: templates/httpd.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      notify: restart apache service

    - name: copy index.html
      template:
        src: templates/index.html.j2
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: start httpd
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
----

[NOTE]
====
What actions are performed by the playbook we just wrote?

- `file:` This module is used to create, modify, delete files, directories, and symlinks.
- `template:` This module specifies that a jinja2 template is being used and deployed. `template` is part of the `Files`
  module family and we encourage you to check out all of the other link:{file_url}[file-management modules here].
- *jinja-who?* - Not to be confused with 2013's blockbuster "Ninja II - Shadow of a Tear", link:{jinja2_url}[jinja2] is
used in Ansible to transform data inside a template expression, i.e. filters.
- *service* - The Service module starts/stops/restarts services.
====


== Section 3: Defining and Using Handlers

Often, we may find ourselves needing to restart a service or process. Reasons may include the deployment of a configuration file, installation of a new package, etc. Here,  we are going to learn about using handlers in this situation.

There are really two parts to this Section; adding a handler to the playbook and calling the handler after the a task.  We will start with the former.

=== Step 1: Define a handler

[source,bash]
----
  handlers:
    - name: restart apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes
----

[NOTE]
====

- `handler:` This is telling the *play* that the `tasks:` are over, and now we are defining `handlers:`.
  Everything below that looks the same as any other task, i.e. you give it a name, a module, and the options for that
  module.  This is the definition of a handler.

====
=== Step 2: Calling the handlers
[NOTE]

You can't have a former if you don't mention the latter

- `notify: restart apache service` ...and here is your latter. Finally!  The `notify` statement is the invocation of a handler by
name.  Quite the reveal, we know.   You already noticed that you've added a `notify` statement to the `copy httpd.conf`
task, now you know why.
===

== Section 4: Review

Your new, improved playbook is done! But don't run it just yet, we'll do that in our next exercise.  For now, let's take a second look to make sure everything
looks the way you intended.  If not, now is the time to fix it up. The figure below shows line counts and spacing.


[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: web
  name: This is a play within a playbook
  become: yes
  vars:
    httpd_packages:
      - httpd
      - mod_wsgi
    apache_test_message: This is a test message
    apache_max_keep_alive_requests: 115

  tasks:
    - name: httpd packages are present
      package:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: "{{ httpd_packages }}"
      notify: restart apache service

    - name: site-enabled directory is present
      file:
        name: /etc/httpd/conf/sites-enabled
        state: directory

    - name: latest httpd.conf is present
      template:
        src: templates/httpd.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      notify: restart apache service

    - name: latest index.html is present
      template:
        src: templates/index.html.j2
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: httpd is started and enabled
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

  handlers:
    - name: restart apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes

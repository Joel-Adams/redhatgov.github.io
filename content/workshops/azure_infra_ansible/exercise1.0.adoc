= Exercise 1.0 - Logging into Azure CLI


== Section 1: Azure CLI

For our first exercise, we are going to log into Azure CLI. This is the way we will be connecting to the Azure infrastructure to run our Ansible Automation.

=== Set Up Dependencies:

Azure CLI has already been installed for you. For more information on how it is installed please see link:{dir_url}[Install the Azure CLI].

=== Step 1: Log into Azure CLI

Let's start with something basic - logging into the Azure CLI

[source,bash]
----
az login
----

Once that command is run, it will return a URL and and authorization code. Please bring up a second browser tab and enter that URL and Authorization code.

Email: {{< urifqdn_azure_login "Student" "@snxcsp.onmicrosoft.com" >}}
Password: RedHatSNX123!

[NOTE]
There are multiple ways to authenticate Ansible with Azure. For reference documentation on different connection styles including the use of service principals please see link:{ansible_azure_url}[Azure Authentication Guide].
We will be using Azure CLI for this workshop due to its ease of use.


=== Step 2: Log into the Azure Portal

Now let's see what resources we have available currently in our Azure Portal.

To log into the Azure Portal please right click link:{azure_portal_url}[here] and open in a new tab.

[NOTE]
If you are not automatically logged into the Azure portal, please use the Email address and Password above to log in.

Once logged in select Resources to review your current Resources inside Azure.

[NOTE]
As you can tell, there are currently no resources inside your Resource Group.

=== Step 3: Create a hosts file for your Ansible inventory

Use `vi` or `vim` to open a file called `hosts`

[source,bash]
----
localhost
----

Save the file by pressing *Esc* then typing *:wq* and pressing *Enter*.

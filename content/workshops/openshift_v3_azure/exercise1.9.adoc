= Exercise 1.9 - Blue-Green Deployments

== Section 1: Blue-Green Deployments

The purpose of this short lab is to demonstrate how simple it is to implement Blue-Green Deployments in OpenShift v3.

In this Lab, we will be:

- Deploying two versions of the same application. The first version will display a blue rectangle.

- Create a FQDN that can be used to expose the applications.

- We will first expose the first application.

- We will also create another version of this application in the same project that displays a green rectangle.

- We will then switch the FQDN to from the first application (blue) to the second application (green).

*Part I*

=== Step 1: Create a new project

[source,bash]
----
oc new-project bluegreen-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}} --display-name="Blue Green Project" --description="Blue Green Project"
----

=== Step 2: List existing image builder or image streams

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app -S --image-stream=php
----

=== Step 3: Create an application

We will be using a sample application that displays a blue or green rectangle. The sample app can be browsed at https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen

We will be using an env var in order to change the color of the box; but in practice you would use a different branch for each version of the code. (E.g. v1 branch and v2 branch)

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app --image-stream=php --code=https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen --env COLOR=blue --name=blue
----

=== Step 4: Monitor the application build

[source,bash]
----
oc get builds
----

Using the build name of the recently created application run:

[source,bash]
----
oc logs build/blue-1
----

Once the build finishes you should see something similar to:

image::lab9-oc_logs_blue1.png['oc_logs_blue1', width=1024]

=== Step 5: Check application deployment status

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

Notice that the build pod has exited and you now have a single instance of the application running under one single pod.

=== Step 6: List the service

[source,bash]
----
oc get service
----

=== Step 7: Create a route for the application

*Remember to substitute the username and FQDN*. Expose the service:

[source,bash]
----
oc expose service blue --hostname=bluegreen.{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io --name=bluegreen
----

=== Step 8: Test the application

[source,bash]
----
oc get route
----

Copy the HOST/PORT and paste it in your browser. You should see something similar to:

image::lab9-blue_deployment.jpeg['blue_deployment', width=1024]

At this point you have deployed an application that displays for illustration purposes a blue rectangle for version 1.

*Part II*

In this part, we will:

- Deploy a new version of this application (Same one as before with a very small change)
- Point the previously created FQDN (route) to the new service that will be created as part of the new application creation process.

image::lab9-blue_green_active_green.png['blue_green_active_green', width=1024]

=== Step 1: Create new version of the application

Create a new application the same way as you did above in Part I. Make sure to name the application as `green' this time.

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app --image-stream=php --code=https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen --env COLOR=green --name=green
----

Wait until the application is built and deployed. You should now see two services if you run:

[source,bash]
----
oc get service
----

Edit the previously created route and change the service name (from `blue` to `green`), the service name will be located in the `spec:` section. You are essentially still using the FQDN you had previously created. However, that route will now point to a different (green) service.

[source,bash]
----
oc edit route bluegreen
----

[source,bash]
----
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.

----

== Step 2: Test the application

[source,bash]
----
oc get route
----

- Copy the HOST/PORT and paste it in your browser.
- You should now see the new version of the recently deployed application with a green rectangle.

*Part III*

You can route traffic to both services. This is also known as "cannary in a colemine".

Log into the web console if you are not already then select the Blue Green Project.

=== Step 1: *Edit Your Route* Using the lefthand side navigation; click on *Applications → Routes*. This will bring you to the *Route* overview page.

image::lab9-bg-routes-page.png['bg-routes-page', width=1024]

Here, click on the *bluegreen* route. The page after will display the current configuration. On the upper right hand side, click on *Actions → Edit*. You should see a page similar to this one.

image::lab9-bg-edit-route.png['bg-edit-route', width=1024]

Next, tick on `Split traffic across multiple services`

Here, set the weight to 50% on blue and 50% on green. This will make it to where half the traffic will go to the green application and half to the blue application.

image::lab9-bg-5050-split.png['bg-5050-split', width=1024]

Once you click on *Save*; you should see this on the Route Overview page.

image::lab9-bg_5050.png['bg_5050', width=1024]

=== Step 2: Test Your Settings

If you try and visit your application; you’ll notice it won’t "switch" over to the other application. This is because the default behavior is:

- Sticky Session on the Router
- Session Cookie set on the router

To get "true" round robin; annotate your route with the following

[source,bash]
----
oc annotate route/bluegreen haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin
oc annotate route/bluegreen haproxy.router.openshift.io/disable_cookies=true
----

Summary

- Blue-Green deployments can be easily accomplished in OpenShift v3.
- We have shown multiple versions of an application; all running concurrently, each with a unique service.
- All that is needed to expose any of the applications is to change the service being used by the route to publicly advertise the application.
- You can split traffic accross two services

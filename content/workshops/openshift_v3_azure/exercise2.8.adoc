= Exercise 2.8 - Dynamic configuration updates using ConfigMap

== Section 1: Dynamic configuration updates using ConfigMap

In this lab, we will learn how to dynamically update this configuration in a running pod. We will do this with an example by changing the database connection to use a PostgreSQL database.

In the last lab, we created a configuration to connect to the MySQL database by mounting *application.properties* file using ConfigMap.

=== Step 1: Create PostgreSQL Pod

Ensure you are in the spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}

Based on what you have learned in the previous labs, create a new Postgresql database pod i.e. *Add to project*, search for *postgresql*, choose *postgresql-ephemeral*. You will need to key in the following values.

- Database Service Name: postgresql
- MySQL Connection Username: user
- MySQL Connection Password: password
- MySQL Database Name: sampledb

Feel free to use your own values, but make a note of the same (write down..we will need these)

Click on the *Create* button and within a few min or two your PostgreSQL database pod should be up and running.

=== Step 2: Add data to the database

While the code has *schema-postgresql.sql* and *data-postgresql.sql* files, these scripts will only be executed if the pod restarts. Since we are going to use this database without restarting the bootapp pod, we will add the data manually.

Select the *postgresql* pod and navigate to the *terminal*.

Login to the database from CLI

[source,bash]
----
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U $POSTGRESQL_USER -q -d $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
----

This will log you into the psql CLI.

Now create the table using the script

[source,bash]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer (
   CUST_ID serial primary key,
   NAME varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   AGE integer NOT NULL);
----

and then add some data as shown below. You can change the values if you wish.

[source,bash]
----
insert into customer (name,age) values ('Joe Psql', 88);
insert into customer (name,age) values ('Jack Psql', 54);
insert into customer (name,age) values ('Ann Psql', 32);
----

These scripts are available here - https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-postgresql.sql

https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-postgresql.sql


=== Step 3: Update ConfigMap

Now let us update the ConfigMap to change the *application.properties* to point to *postgresql* datasource.

Using CLI run the following command after you ensure you are in the spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}} project

[source,bash]
----
oc edit configmap app-props
----
Edit the datasource parameters as below

[source,bash]
----
    spring.datasource.platform=postgresql
    spring.datasource.url= jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}:5432/sampledb
    spring.datasource.username=user
    spring.datasource.password=password
----

*Do this slowly. Double check every parameter*

Specifically note the *spring.datasource.url*. It is in the following format:

spring.datasource.url = jdbc:[databasetype]://[service-host]:[service-port]/[dbname]

Here
- databasetype is `postgresql`
- service-host can be ip-address of the service or the service name. Above, it is configured as service-name.projectname. This is the fully qualified service name discoverable by kubernetes. Kubernetes uses SkyDNS.
- service-port for postgresql is `5432`

*Note* that this change does not redeploy the pod. You can check the pod details to see how long the pod has been running for.

Now verify the application.properties inside the pod (Go to bootapp pod terminal on the Web Console or use oc rsh) . You will note that the *application.properties* file is now updated as a result of updating the ConfigMap.

[source,bash]
----
cat config/application.properties
----

=== Step 4: Test your application

Click the application url now i.e http://bootapp-spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io/.

====
[NOTE]
In this example, I am using a domain name of *104.209.170.217.nip.io*. Ask the instructor for the domain name suffix for your setup an change it.
====

It will open a new tab and your running application will greet you

Hello from bootapp-2-06a4b

Also watch the pod logs either using web console or using CLI. For example `oc logs -f bootapp-2-06a4b` Watch out for connection url in the output.

Now try the /dbtest endpoint i.e. http://bootapp-spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io/dbtest.

Note that the output is still from the MySQLDB.

[source,bash]
----
Customers List

CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Joe Mysql Age: 88
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Jack Mysql Age: 54
CustomerId: 4 Customer Name: Ann Mysql Age: 32
----

Also the pod logs show that connection url is

connection url: jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false

So even after the *application.properties* file is updated in the pod, it is not picked up. The reason is that springboot app caches the environment variables. This application has a *@RefreshScope* annotation. So we can invoke */refresh* endpoint to refresh the cache. Run the following command from CLI to refresh the cache.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://bootapp-spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io/refresh
----

Now note that the pod logs show that the application context is refreshed.

2016-11-18 04:25:35.601  INFO 10 --- [io-8080-exec-10] s.c.a.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext : Refreshing

Now try the /dbtest endpoint again. Now the result will show the data from the postgresql database.

[source,bash]
----
Customers List


CustomerId: 1 Customer Name: Joe Psql Age: 88
CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Jack Psql Age: 54
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Ann Psql Age: 32
----

Also note the logs will show the connection url as

connection url: jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}:5432/sampledb

*Note* in this exercise, the pod was never redeployed. The application.properties were dynamically updated.

*Summary:* In this lab, we have learned the ConfigMapâ€™s flexibility and how it allows dynamic updates to the pod configuration.

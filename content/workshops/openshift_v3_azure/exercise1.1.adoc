= Exercise 1.1 - Running Ad Hoc Commands


== Section 1: Add a new project from command line

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and how to create an application from an existing docker image.

=== Step 1: Add a new project from command line

[source,bash]
----
oc new-project mycliproject-labuser{{< urifqdn_user "" >}} --description="My CLI Project" --display-name="CLI Project"
----

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run the following command

[source,bash]
----
oc get projects
----



If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by issuing `oc project <project name>`. Although you donâ€™t want to do it now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

[source,bash]
----
oc status
----

=== Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image



Next we will create an application inside the above project using an existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on dockerhub that just says 'Welcome to OpenShift V3. Let us just use that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the docker image using the `oc new-app` command as shown below

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app redhatworkshops/welcome-php --name=welcome
----

image::lab1-oc_new_app.png['oc_new_app', width=1024]

The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in a pod. If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

image::lab1-oc_get_pods.png['oc_get_pods', width=1024]

In the above example *welcome-1-deploy* is the deployer pod and the other one is the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer pod will succeed and the application pod will change for *ContainerCreating* to *Running* status.

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

image::lab1-oc_running.png['oc_running', width=1024]

=== Step 3: Add a Route for your application

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the following command to view the list of services in the project (you can also use `oc get svc` shorthand).

[source,bash]
----
oc get services
----

You will notice the *welcome* service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot access this application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose` command will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you can access it from the browser.

[source,bash]
----
oc expose service welcome --name=welcome
----

=== Step 4: Try your application

Access the application: Now access the application using curl (looking for 200 status code) or from the browser and see the result

[source,bash]
----
oc get routes
curl -Is <route>
----

image::lab1-oc_get_route.png['oc_get_route', width=1024]

Voila!! you created your first application using an existing docker image on OpenShift.

=== Step 5: Clean up

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were created in your project.

[source,bash]
----
oc get all
----

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

[source,bash]
----
oc delete all --all
----

You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application, the deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application using an external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more fun stuff!

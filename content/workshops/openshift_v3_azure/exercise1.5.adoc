= Exercise 1.5 - Using Templates

== Section 1: Using Templates

In this lab exercise we will learn how to use OpenShift Web Console to spin up a MySQL database using templates. We will then add a frontend PHP application that accesses this database using the service exposed by the database. We will provide a route (a URL) to access the frontend application from a browser.

=== Step 1: Create a project

Based on the experience gained from the previous exercise, log into the OpenShift Web Console. You will see the list of Projects.

Using the *Create Project* button, create a new project. We will call it *consoleproject-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}*. Type in a *Display Name* and *Description* of your choice.

Press the *Create* button to complete the project creation from the Web Console. This will accomplish the same job as `oc new-project` from CLI.

Select the project from the list of *My Projects*

=== Step 2: Create a MYSQL database using the template

Click on Add to Project → Browse Catolog button and you will be taken to select an image or template. You will see the application create screen as shown below:

Click on *Databases* tab. Find *MySQL* then *MySQL (Ephemeral)* template from the list and click *Select*. You will also notice *MySQL (Persistent)* template. But we will address that in a different lab exercise.

image::lab5-mysql_ephemeral_template.png['mysql_ephemeral_template', width=1024]

You will be taken to the mysql ephemeral creation screen. Click *Next* parameters and edit the values to use the following values:

- Database Service Name: mysql
- MySQL Connection Username: pricelist
- MySQL Connection Password: pricelist
- MySQL root user Password: pricelist
- MySQL Database Name: pricelist

image::lab5-mysql_ephemeral_creation.png['mysql_ephemeral_creation', width=1024]

Click the *Next* button.

Click the checkbox to create the secret

image::lab5-mysql_secret_binding.png['mysql_secret_binding', width=1024]

Click *Create*

Click *Continue to project overview*.

It will take you back to the project overview page and soon you will see an image of a running pod.

image::lab5-mysql_pod_on_proj_overview.png['mysql_pod_on_proj_overview', width=1024]

Please wait for the Bindings to complete. It may take few minutes.

While we are waiting we can add a lable to the mysql deployment Run the following on the command line:

[source,bash]
----
oc project consoleproject-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}
oc label dc mysql app=pricelist
----

=== Step 3: Add a PHP frontend to talk to this database

In this step we will add a PHP frontend application that talks to recently created database. The code is available on github at

https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/php-pricelist

Browse through the code in this repository. If you take a look at the *database configuration* file (config/database.php) you will see that it reads the values from environment varables.

To add a frontend through the web console click on *Add to Project → Browse Catalog* This will take you to the Service Catalog. Select Languages → PHP → PHP

Click *Next* parameters and edit the values to use the following values:

- Application Name: pricelist
- Git Repository: https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/php-pricelist

Click onto the link *Advanced Options* Go to Deployment Configuration section and enter the following environment variables:

  Name               Value
  MYSQL_USER         pricelist
  MYSQL_PASSWORD     pricelist
  MYSQL_DATABASE     pricelist

In the Labels section add the following label if its not there:

`* app=pricelist`

image::lab5-php.png['php', width=1024]

image::lab5-dbtest_deployment_env.png['dbtest_deployment_env', width=1024]

Click *Create* to add this frontend application to talk to the database.

image::lab5-cakephp_confirm.png['cakephp_confirm', width=1024]

Click *Continue to product overview*.

You will be taken back to the Project Overview page and you will start seeing that a new service is now available and exposed as a route. Since you labeled both frontend web and backend db as *app=pricelist* it will show as one application

You will also notice that a build starts running very soon. Once the build completes, the application image created from the source code will be uploaded to the docker repository.

image::lab5-console_project_overview.png['console_project_overview', width=1024]

You can check the build logs using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc logs -f build/pricelist-1
----

Once the build completes, OpenShift initiates a deploy process. Once the deployment is complete, the frontend pod starts running. You will find the running pod when you navigate to *Applications→Pods* on the Web console.

Now use `curl` to run the database `bootstrap` script

[source,bash]
----
curl -k http://$(oc get route/pricelist -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/create_database.php
----

image::lab5-curl_output.png['curl_output', width=1024]

Go ahead and open your application. The URL will be displayed by `oc get route`

[source,bash]
----
oc get route
----

When you open your application, click on the "Create Record" button and create a record. Once you added a record, click on "Read Records". The page should look like this.

image::lab5-application_create_screen.png['application_create_screen', width=1024]

You can verify this by logging into the database using `oc rsh`

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

image::lab5-oc_rsh.png['oc_rsh', width=1024]

Here you’ll notice that the database pod is called `mysql-1-rxnlp`. Login to this pod using `oc rsh`

[source,bash]
----
oc rsh mysql-1-9v7r5
----

Run 'mysql -u root pricelist' to login and run the query.

[source,bash]
----
mysql -u root pricelist
----

[source,bash]
----
SELECT * FROM products;
----

image::lab5-sql_select.png['sql_select', width=1024]

[source,bash]
----
\q
exit
----

In this lab exercise you have seen a complete web application deployed using OpenShift templates in two parts. First we deployed the MySQL database. We added data manually by getting into the pod. Then we added the frontend code that was built using the OpenShift S2I process. You configured this frontend application to access the database using a service, in this case, the ``mysql`` service. The frontend is made accessible using a route for which you gave a URL.

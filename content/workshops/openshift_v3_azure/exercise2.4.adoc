= Exercise 2.4 - Using Persistent Storage

== Section 1: Using Persistent Storage

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how you can request storage from OpenShift and have it attach to your application.

Containers, by design, are ephemeral. In short, if you want your application to store persistent data; you will need to attach to a backend storage system.

In this Lab, we will be:

- Deploying an application that takes uploads
- Upload a File, and delete the pod
- Attach persistant storage
- Upload a File, and delete the pod

*NOTE*: Storage provisioning must be setup by the Operations Team before proceeding.


=== Step 1: Deploy Application

Create a project called storage-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}} and deploy the application

[source,bash]
----
oc new-project storage-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}} --description="My Storage-project" --display-name="Storage Project"
oc new-app php~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/openshift-php-upload-demo
----

[source,bash]
----
oc logs -f build/openshift-php-upload-demo-1
----

Once the application is deployed expose the route

[source,bash]
----
oc get svc
----

[source,bash]
----
oc expose svc openshift-php-upload-demo
----

[source,bash]
----
oc get route
----

Visit your application; it should look like this

=== Step 2: Test with ephemeral storage

Pick a file to upload and upload it to the app. Once uploaded you can view a list of file when you click *List Uploaded Files*. It should look something like this

image::lab13-list-uploaded-files.png['list-uploaded-files', width=1024]

You can see where the uploaded files are if you use `oc rsh`. They are uploaded under ``/opt/app-root/src/uploaded`

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

image::lab13-oc_get_pods.png['oc_get_pods', width=1024]

[source,bash]
----
oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-1-hwn8l
----

[source,bash]
----
ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
----

[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Delete this pod.

[source,bash]
----
oc delete pod openshift-php-upload-demo-1-hwn8l
----

Now login to your new pod that got spun up.

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

image::lab12-oc_get_pods.png['oc_get_pods', width=1024]

[source,bash]
----
oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-1-wnv4r
----

[source,bash]
----
ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
----

[IMPORTANT]
Notice your data is GONE!

[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Since we dont have any persistent storage attached to the container the data we uploaded is no longer available.

=== Step 3: Requesting Storage

In OpenShift, Storage is abstracted out to where one simply "requests" storage and it’s up to the backend adminsitrator to provide the solution

Log into the console and select your *Storage Project*

On the left side of the webconsole click on "*Storage*". It will bing you to the storage overview page.

image::lab13-storage-overview.png['storage-overview', width=1024]

In the center; click the "*Create Storage*" button. This will take you to the "*Create Storage*" page.

image::lab13-create-storage.png['create-storage', width=1024]

Here you need to enter the following

- Storage Class: glusterfs-storage
- Name: myclaim
- Access Mode: Shared Access (RWX)
- Size: 1 GiB

The *Name* must be unique to the project namespace. The *Access Mode* means "how many apps can access this storage". For block storage you’d choose *Singe User (RWO)*; in this instance we are choosing *Shared Access (RWX)* (for File based storage like NFS). The Size is set to *1 GB* just for testing.

Once you click on "Create" it’ll go from a *Pending* stage to *Bound*. You can see this on the command-line as well by checking your `pvc` (Which stands for Persistant Volume Claim)

[source,bash]
----
oc get pvc
----

Get yourself familair with the configuration

[source,bash]
----
oc get pvc myclaim -o yaml
----

image::lab13-oc_get_pvc.png['oc_get_pvc', width=1024]

We will now bind this storage to the application’s path of where it is storing the files. This is under ``/opt/app-root/src/uploaded`. You need to add the volume to the `deploymentConfig` of `openshift-php-upload-demo`.

[source,bash]
----
oc volume dc/openshift-php-upload-demo  --add -t pvc --claim-name=myclaim --mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded
----

=== Step 4: Testing Configuration

This will trigger a new deployment. Login to your pod to see the mount.

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

image::lab13-oc_get_pods_new.png['oc_get_pods_new', width=1024]

[source,bash]
----
oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-2-jfz5d
----

[source,bash]
----
df -h /opt/app-root/src/uploaded/
----

[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Upload a file like before.

Visit your application; it should look like this

image::lab13-upload-app.png['upload-app', width=1024]

Pick a file to upload and upload it to the app. Once uploaded you can view a list of file when you click *List Uploaded Files*. It should look something like this

image::lab13-list-uploaded-files.png['list-uploaded-files', width=1024]

Once uploaded; delete the pod

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

[source,bash]
----
oc delete pod openshift-php-upload-demo-2-jfz5d
----

Log into the newly spunup pod and verify that your file is still there!

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

image::lab13-oc_pods.png['oc_pods', width=1024]

[source,bash]
----
oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-2-pktql
----

[source,bash]
----
ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
----

[IMPORTANT]
Notice your data is THERE! The new pod connects to the persistent storage that we created to keep your files available.

[source,bash]
----
exit
----

*Summary*

In this lab you learned how to request, attach, and test persistant storage.

= Exercise 1.3 - Using Web Console

== Section 1: Using Web Console

In this lab exercise, we will review the OpenShift Web Console.

=== Step 1: Navigating the web console

Type in the master public URL provided by your instructor in a browser.

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn_openshift "https://""""">}}
----

====
[NOTE]
Your browser may complain about the serverâ€™s security certificates not trusted by your computer. You can agree to proceed to the master URL.

Key in the *username* and *password* provided by the instructor. You will now see the Service Catalog. Your created project will be listed on the right

[source,bash]
----
login: {{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}
Password: SNX2018

Click on "View All" on the right. You will see the list of projects now. Note the project you created in the last lab exercise is shown here.

Also note the *Create Project* button which allows you to create a new project from Web Console.

If you see *An error occurred getting metrics* then:

    1. Click *Open Metrics URL*

    2. Click *Advanced* link

    3. Click *Proceed to hawkular.<> (unsafe)*

    4. Refresh the browser where you login at OpenShift console.

Now click on the CLI Project to view the details. OpenShift takes you by default to the *Overview* page and shows you a graphic representation of the application that is deployed here. You can see that a single pod is running and is front ended by a service. Note the route that you configured for this service is also shown. You will also see the *Add to Project* button on the top. This can be used to create new application from Web Console inside this project.

Select *Builds* under *Builds* tab, you will see all the build configurations. Click onto each build configuration and select the *Configuration* tab, we will be able to view all the build details.

Select *Pods* under *Applications* tab, you will find a running pod that is running your application image. Note that it also tells you the node on which the pod is running and other details about this pod. You will also see the build pod that had succeeded.

Click onto running pod, it shows the details on the pod. In addition, metrics, logs and terminal also available for monitoring.

Click *Builds* on left menu and select *Builds*. Select the build name *myhttpdapp* and then click on *Configuration* tab. Note there are webhook URLs. We will use them in a later lab exercise. You can start a build from the Web Console by pressing the *Start Build* button in the right top corner. It also gives you a command to start the build from CLI.

- Select *Services* under *Applications* tab, you will find the service created for your application. Click onto one of the services, it shows all the details about the service along with the option to expose it as a route.

- Select *Routes* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the routes in the project. Click onto a route, it shows all the details for this route.

- Select *Deployments* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the deployments. Click onto a deployment, it shows all the details of the deployment. By pressing the *Deploy* button, you will be able to start a deployment from the web console.

- Select *Monitoring* tab, you will see all the events for the project. Also latest events grouped by resource type.

- Select *Images* under *Builds* tab, it shows the list of image streams for the project. Click onto the specific image stream, it shows more details about the image stream.

Click on the *Resources* tab on the left to see that it would display the Quotas and Other Resources, if they exist. We will deal with them in a different lab exercise.

= Exercise 3.1 - Creating a Pipeline

== Section 1: Creating a Pipeline

In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and deployments on OpenShift.

*Prerequisites:*

- You need a github account if you want to make changes and test the pipeline kick-off.

=== Step 1: Create a new project

Create a new project on the OpenShift cluster with name `pipeline-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}`

=== Step 2: Deploy your CI/CD tool (Jenkins)

Click on *Add to Project* on the Web console, and navigate to *Import YAML / JSON* tab.

In the text box with heading *Upload file by dragging & dropping, selecting it, or pasting from the clipboard*, copy and paste the Build Configuration the following Build Configuration and press on *Create*.

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: myfirstpipeline
  labels:
    name: myfirstpipeline
  annotations:
    pipeline.alpha.openshift.io/uses: '[{"name": "myphp", "namespace": "", "kind": "DeploymentConfig"}]'
spec:
  triggers:
    -
      type: GitHub
      github:
        secret: secret101
    -
      type: Generic
      generic:
        secret: secret101
  runPolicy: Serial
  source:
    type: None
  strategy:
    type: JenkinsPipeline
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      jenkinsfile: "node() {\nstage 'build'\nopenshiftBuild(buildConfig: 'myphp', showBuildLogs: 'true')\nstage 'deploy'\nopenshiftDeploy(deploymentConfig: 'myphp')\nopenshiftScale(deploymentConfig: 'myphp',replicaCount: '2')\n}"
  output:
  resources:
  postCommit:
----

Note that the build configuration uses *JenkinsPipelineStrategy*. Also the *spec.strategy.jenkinsPipelineStrategy.jenkinsfile* is the actual pipeline that runs. We will discuss that in the next step.

This will spin up a Jenkins pod. Give it a few minutes as it takes time to download and deploy jenkins. You will also see the URL assigned to your Jenkins. It would be something like https://jenkins-pipeline-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io

If you click on that URL, you will be taken to Jenkins Console. *Note:* The browser may complain that the URL is insecure. Click on advanced and proceed to url.

At the next step, choose *Login with OpenShift* and enter your openshift credentials to login.

On the next screen, *allow all Requested Permissions*

Now you will be taken to Jenkins console (that is running on OpenShift).


=== Step 3: Updating the pipeline

Using left menu on the Openshift Web Console, select *Builds→Pipelines*. You will see that *myfirstpipeline* is created. Click on that.

Since we haven’t run the pipeline yet, the History tab shows nothing. If you click on the *Configuration* tab, you will see the build configuration details.

*Note* There are webhook urls on this page. We will come back to this and use after a couple of steps.

Review the Jenkinsfile on this page.

- It has two stages *build* and *deploy*
- In the *build* stage the *openshiftBuild* plugin is used to trigger a build named *myphp*
- In the *deploy* stage the *openshiftDeploy* plugin invokes a deployment configuration *myphp* and then invokes *openshiftScale* plugin to scale up the same deployment configuration to 2 replicas.

This means that we need a build configuration and deployment configuration for our application, but we want these triggered by our pipeline (not auto-triggered by default). So let us create an application *myphp* with the build configuration and deployment configuration so that we can trigger it using this Jenkins pipeline.


=== Step 4: Create an application

Clone the following application into your github account https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/bluegreen if you haven’t already done it in a previous lab.

- Click on *Add to Project* on the project and select *PHP* latest image. We will use *myphp* as the application name. *Note* same name will be used for buildConfig and deployConfig by default.
- Use your own github url if you want to test by pushing changes to code https://github.com/*GithubUserName*/bluegreen. Otherwise you can use https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/bluegreen.
- Now click on the link *advanced options*. It will open up a bunch of options and we will edit those. Under the section *Build Configuration*, *uncheck* all the three check boxes for the following options

[source,bash]
----
Configure a webhook build trigger
Automatically build a new image when the builder image changes
Launch the first build when the build configuration is created
----

image::lab19-build_config.png['build_config', width=1024]

By unchecking these, we are disabling the start of the builds as we want to control those using pipeline.

In the section Deployment Configuration, uncheck the two auto-deploy options

- New image is available
- Deployment configuration changes

image::lab19-deployment_config.png['deployment_config', width=1024]

By unchecking these, we are disabling the start of the deployments as we want to control those using pipeline.

Now scroll down and click on the *Create* button.

This will create the required objects (build configuration, deployment configuration, imagestream, service and route) but won’t start a build.

=== Step 5: Start pipeline

Now click on the *Start Pipeline* button to start the pipeline.

Notice the pipeline starts and *build* and *deploy* stages are executed.

image::lab19-pipeline_complete.png['pipeline_complete', width=1024]

Click on the *View log* link for the pipeline. It’ll take you to Jenkins and show the logs.

image::lab19-jenkins_log.png['jenkins_log', width=1024]

In a couple of minutes, the *build* and *deploy* will complete, and your applicaiton will be deployed and scaled to 2 replicas.

Now if we click on *Overview*, *myphp* and select the route, we should see our blue box outline.

=== Step 6: Configure webhook and trigger with changes

Navigate back to the *configuration tab* for the pipeline as explained in Step 3. Copy the value for *Github webhook* url.

Based on what you learn in the past, go to your github repository that you cloned and set up a webhook pointing to this URL.

Tips

- Navigate to Settings → Webhooks on your project in github and click *Add webhook*
- Set the`Payload URL` to Github Webhook URL noted above
- Make sure the Content Type is set to application/json
- Press on Disable SSL
- Press on Add Webhook

Now edit the *image.php* file to uncomment the *image filled rectangle* and comment the *Image Fill To Border* shown below

[source,bash]
----
// Draw a filled rectangle
imagefilledrectangle($im, 0, 0, 199, 199, $color);
//ImageFillToBorder($im, 0, 0, $white, $white);
imageRectangle($im, 0, 0, 199, 199, $color);
----

and *Commit* changes.

Come back and watch the Web Console, you will notice that a new build has just started in the build pipeline. Once the build completes, you will also see the rolling deployment of the pods.

Now if we click on *Overview*, *myphp* and select the route, we should see our blue box filled in.

Bonus Points: Watch the videos here https://blog.openshift.com/create-build-pipelines-openshift-3-3/ and understand how to create a pipeline that goes across multiple projects.

Congratulations!! In this lab, you have learned how to set up and run your own CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift.

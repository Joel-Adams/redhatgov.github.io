= Exercise 2.7 - Using ConfigMap to add a Backend Database configuration to the application

== Section 1: Using ConfigMap to add a Backend Database configuration to the application

In this exercise we will add a backend database to the previous deployed SpringBoot application using ConfigMaps.

If you already created the SpringBoot application in the previous lab deploy a spring boot application, just test one more thing (you may have to create a route for this service). Try your application url with /dbtest (http://bootapp-spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io/dbtest) extension and it should list you some data from the HSQLDB configured within the same app.

====
[NOTE]
In this example, I am using a domain name of *104.209.170.217.nip.io*. Ask the instructor for the domain name suffix for your setup an change it.
====

Let’s take a moment to understand how this application is connecting to the HSQLDB. Look at the application.properties file in the code https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/application.properties and we have configured these spring datasource variables to use hsqldb.

- spring.datasource.platform=hsqldb
- spring.datasource.url= jdbc:hsqldb:file:/opt/app-root/src/mydb;shutdown=true
- spring.datasource.username=user
- spring.datasource.password=password

Of course, https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/pom.xml has the required dependencies. So springboot is able to create the in memory database.

Where is the data coming from? See these two files:

- https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-hsqldb.sql is creating the schema
- https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-hsqldb.sql is adding data.

This is the data displayed when you invoke dbtest endpoint. Pretty straight forward.. isn’t it!!

In this lab, we will deploy the same as a 2-tier application by adding a MySQL database running as a separate pod.

=== Step 1: Add a MySQL database to this project

Based on what you learned in the previous labs, you know what to do!!

Make sure you are in the spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}} project where your springboot application is running. Click on *Add to project* on your webconsole, select *MySQL Ephemeral* from the catalog and deploy it. When you are deploying this database you will have to choose the following values:

- Database Service Name: mysql
- MySQL Connection Username: user
- MySQL Connection Password: password
- MySQL Database Name: sampledb

Feel free to use your own values, but make a note of the same (write down..we will need these)

Click on the *Next* button then *Create* button and within a few min or two your MySQL database pod should be up and running.

=== Step 2: Configuring database connection params

The simplest way is to edit *application.properties* file to the values you noted in the last step i.e.

- spring.datasource.platform=mysql
- spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
- spring.datasource.username=user
- spring.datasource.password=password

*But wait, that requires you to rebuild he code and deploy.*

So, is there another way?.. *Yes* Let’s use a `ConfigMap`.

ConfigMaps allow you to keep the configuration artifacts decoupled from the image content. More details https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/configmaps.html. We will see use them here and understand their flexibility in the next lab.

Lets go to CLI.

Change to spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}} project

[source,bash]
----
oc project spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}
----

Create a new file with name `application.properties` with the following content.

[source,bash]
----
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
----

You need to make sure that you substitute the correct values you noted in the last step when you wre creating the service. *Be extra-careful.. read instructions below.*

Specifically note the datasource url. It is in the following format:

spring.datasource.url = jdbc:[databasetype]://[service-host]:[service-port]/[dbname]?useSSL=false

You can replace `service-host` by the IP address of your MySQL service or the Service name. In the above example, I am using the service name for example mysql.spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}. Here mysql is the name of the service and spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}} is the project name. This is a fully qualified way to let your application do service discovery in OpenShift (it uses SkyDNS).

Now let’s create a ConfigMap with name `app-props` by running

[source,bash]
----
oc create configmap app-props --from-file=application.properties
----

Try a couple of more commands

[source,bash]
----
oc describe configmap app-props
----

image::lab15-oc_describe.png['oc_describe', width=1024]

If you made a mistake you can always edit the ConfigMap using

[source,bash]
----
oc edit configmap app-props
----

So far, we have created a ConfigMap in the project but your springboot application does not know how to use it.

=== Step 3: Edit Deployment Configuration

Now we will mount the ConfigMap so that the springboot application can use it.

Note there could be multiple spec's in your DC.

We will now add a volume that points to our ConfigMap right under spec. It is explained here https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/configmaps.html#configmaps-use-case-consuming-in-volumes

[source,bash]
----
oc set volumes dc/bootapp --add -m /opt/app-root/src/config --configmap-name=app-props
----

So what is this location `/opt/app-root/src/config`?

If you get into the terminal of the pod (you should know how to do this by now!) and run `pwd`, it will show that the home directory is ``/opt/app-root/src`. If you copy the `application.properties` file in the `config` folder, SpringBoot will pick that first. Hence we mounted the folder `/opt/app-root/src/config`.

Save the changes and exit. If you now got the Overview page, you will see that the pod gets re-deployed. Yes, redeployed, not rebuilt (no S2I build process).

=== Step 4: Verify the changes

Once the deployment is complete

- click on *Applications* then *Pods*
- click on the *mysql* pod name
- go to the *Terminal* tab
- verify that your `application.properties` are now available in the config folder

Note the contents of this file are what you added to the ConfigMap.

=== Step 5: Test your application

Go back to the Overview page. Click on your application url which would be something like http://bootapp-spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io/

====
[NOTE]
In this example, I am using a domain name of *104.209.170.217.nip.io*. Ask the instructor for the domain name suffix for your setup an change it.
====

It will open a new tab and your running application will greet you

Hello from bootapp-2-06a4b

Now move back to your webconsole and watch the pod logs. You can also do this from CLI by running

[source,bash]
----
oc logs -f bootapp-2-06a4b
----

Now access the application with the /dbtest extension - http://bootapp-spring-{{< urifqdn_user "labuser""" >}}.104.209.170.217.nip.io/dbtest

It should show the data from your MySQL database.

Where did this data come from? Look at * https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-mysql.sql was used to initialize the MySQL database * https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-mysql.sql was used to populate data. I added `Mysql' as part of the names to make it easy ;)

Also note that your logs show the connection url, just to verify which database you are connecting to.
